# racingLine
This project is nowhere near done, but feel free to look around if you like. The goal is to track F1 cars going around the track and tracking how far they are off from the ideal racing line. I am mostly trying to work with functionality that comes with OpenCV to get to know it better, so some of it may be familiar.
